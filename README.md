Crop Recommendation System
A Machine Learning project that recommends the most suitable crop to grow based on soil, climate, and environmental conditions.
This system uses historical agricultural data and ML algorithms to help farmers and agricultural planners make informed decisions.

 Features
Crop Prediction: Suggests the best crop for given soil & climate data.

User Input: Takes parameters such as:
1]Nitrogen (N)
2]Phosphorus (P)
3]Potassium (K)
4]Temperature
5]Humidity
6]pH level
7]Rainfall

# Machine Learning Model: Uses classification algorithms to predict the crop.
# Data Visualization: Graphs and charts to understand data distribution.
# Web/App Interface: Google URL
